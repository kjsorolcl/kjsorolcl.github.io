======================================================================


1. Purposes
-----------
This software is a keyboard emulator for joysticks.
It converts joystick input into keyboard input (and mouse input).

Use it when you want to control an application with joysticks that
doesn't support joystick input. If you wish, you can control even
Word, Excel, etc. with joysticks!


2. Features
-----------
* Configuration for max 16 Joysticks.
  (6 Axes and 32 Buttons for each Joystick)

* You can make many configuration files, and choose it in any time.

* Support for automatic shooting.

* Support for Mouse emulation (including wheel support).

* Support for "Adjust mouse movements" button
  When it's pressed, mouse movement(or wheel rotation) becomes
  faster (or slower).

* Support for "Use setting of the other joystick" button
  (Something like "shift" command of SNESKey.
   For example, you may use joystick1 for keyboard emulation usually,
   but during this button being pressed, joystick3's configuration
   (that emulates mouse or something) will temporarily be used.)


3. Installation
---------------
Simply unzip the archive file into some folder.
To uninstall this software, you only need to remove that folder.


4. Usage
--------
* Push "Create" button and make a new configuration

* Choose the button of the joystick from the list
  and double click or push return key.

* "Use setting of the other number of joystick temporarily" feature may
  be hard to understand at first, but it is very useful for Joystick
  which has few buttons.

  During the button be pressed, the rest of button's assignment temporarily
  be changed to other assignment. So you can virtually use twice or more
  number of buttons.

* Configuration file (*.cfg) is simply a text file. So, If you want to
  rename the configuration, copy the configuration, ...etc.,
  terminate the "JoyToKey" and simply rename or copy the file (*.cfg).


5. Misc
-------
* If you want to control Internet Explorer 4.0 with joysticks,
  configure as follows...

  "Back" : Alt + Left
Å@"Close Window" : Alt + F + C
Å@"Move To Menu" : Alt + F

  And you'll want to add Wheel rotation, Mouse movement etc., too.

  Other Windows applications will also be configured like this.

* Known limitations
  These won't work.
    1. Alt or Ctrl key emulation for MS-DOS application
    2. All key emulation for Windows application using DirectInput


6. Changes
----------
Ver3.6
* Automatic shooting support for mouse's button emulation.

Ver3.0-3.5
* Old version
